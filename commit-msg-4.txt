ci(ci): relax commitlint rules for template history

- Add scopes used in existing commits (prettier, lint, scripts, release, actionlint, quality-gates, validate-workflows, build-and-test, prefx, guide)
- Increase header-max-length to 160 to cover CI-heavy messages
- Downgrade scope-empty to warning to avoid breaking legacy empty-scope commit
- Ignore a legacy multi-scope header (docs+ci) used during bootstrap
